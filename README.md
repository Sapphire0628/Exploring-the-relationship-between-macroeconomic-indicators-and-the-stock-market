# An Investigation into the Correlation Between Macroeconomic Indicators and Stock Market Performance

## Introduction

This project analyzed the link between GDP, CPI, and stock markets in the US, China, and Japan from 2001 to 2022. It found that GDP and CPI can predict stock market movements, displaying Granger Causality. Generally, they share a long-term trend, but stock markets and CPI don't always align. There's a strong correlation between these economic indicators and stock market performance, with CPI having a more significant influence than GDP, particularly in Japan and China. In essence, this study highlights the predictive value of GDP and CPI in stock market analysis, with varying impacts across the examined countries.
